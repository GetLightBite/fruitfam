To collect images from the kalekam project, copy the code in `collect_burrito_image.py` and paste into a kalekam repl in the burrito repo. A json file will be created with all the image urls in it.

To remove a list of incorrect image urls from this list, run `python filter_images.py`

To test a trained SVM on a set of test images run `python test_svm.py`
